%% The options are (you can only choose one from each group):
%%
%% 10pt, 11pt, 12pt: chooses the point size for the document. "11pt" is the
%%                   default.
%%
%% oneside, twoside: whether you want your document onesided or twosided. Note
%%                   that twosided is not guaranteed to work, and style
%%                   guidelines prohibit double sided printouts on final
%%                   copy. "oneside" is the default.
%%
%% draft, final: when printing drafts you can save a lot of paper by using the
%%               "draft" option. It switches to single spacing, displays overful
%%               hboxes with a black box, prints a version number on title page 
%%               and omits signature page. Of course for the final copy make
%%               sure to use the "final" option! "final" is the default.
%%
%% thesis, dissertation: switches between the style for a master's thesis and a 
%%                       Ph.D. dissertation. The differences are fairly minor
%%                       and limited to the front matter. "thesis" is the
%%                       default.
%%
%% actual, proposal: switches between actual document and proposal mode. In
%%                   proposal mode: the title page is simplified and the
%%                   version number is always printed.

%% Full title of \textbf{}thesis or dissertation, capitalized like a title should be.
\title{RADGRAD: Using Degree Planning, Social Networking, and Gamification to Improve Academic, Professional, and Social Engagement During the Undergraduate Computer Science Degree Experience}
%% Your name, capitalized normally. Do not include any titles like Dr.

%% Presumably this will be one of: May, August, or December.

%% and it is customary to list the outside committee member (if you have one)
%% last.
\othermembers{Dan Suthers\\Michael-Brian Ogawa}
%% The field in which you are obtaining your degree, capitalized normally.
\field{Computer Science}
%% If your discipline allows subfields, you can add it here. Note that this
%% is strictly controlled, so consult the Style & Policy guide before adding
%% a subfield.
%\subfield{Bioinformatics}
%% 4-6 optional keywords/phrases for use in indexing or as search terms
\keywords{Software Development, Educational Technology, Social Network, Degree Planner, Gamification}
%% The version number of your document. Consistent use of this will enable you
%% to tell old drafts from new ones. Final actual documents omit this
%% automatically so you can use it without fear of submission problems at the
%% end. If you do not define this parameter, it defaults to "1.0.0".
