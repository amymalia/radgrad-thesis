First, I would like to thank Prof. Philip Johnson for his endless enthusiasm, positive energy, and wisdom, which enabled me to complete my thesis within a year with minimum pain. Next, I would like to thank Prof. Dan Suthers and Prof. Michael Brian Ogawa for being on my committee and being patient with me as I attempted to organize my thesis both in my head and on paper. I would also like to thank Prof. Cam Moore for patiently providing me with his RadGrad advice and life wisdom during the past year. I would also like to thank Josephine Garces and Aljon Preza for their selfless contributions to the RadGrad development. Additionally, I would like to thank the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory (CSDL) for providing me with an office with a window. Finally, I would like to thank Gerald Lau for letting me sit in his office and talk to him about spaghetti for an entire month.
